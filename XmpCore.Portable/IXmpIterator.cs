    /// <remarks>
    /// <c>XMPIterator</c> provides a uniform means to iterate over the
    /// schema and properties within an XMP object.
    /// <para />
    /// The iteration over the schema and properties within an XMP object is very
    /// complex. It is helpful to have a thorough understanding of the XMP data tree.
    /// One way to learn this is to create some complex XMP and examine the output of
    /// <c>XMPMeta#toString</c>. This is also described in the XMP
    /// Specification, in the XMP Data Model chapter.
    /// <para />
    /// The top of the XMP data tree is a single root node. This does not explicitly
    /// appear in the dump and is never visited by an iterator (that is, it is never
    /// returned from <c>XMPIterator#next()</c>). Beneath the root are
    /// schema nodes. These are just collectors for top level properties in the same
    /// namespace. They are created and destroyed implicitly. Beneath the schema
    /// nodes are the property nodes. The nodes below a property node depend on its
    /// type (simple, struct, or array) and whether it has qualifiers.
    /// <para />
    /// An <c>XMPIterator</c> is created by XMPMeta#iterator() constructor
    /// defines a starting point for the iteration and options that control how it
    /// proceeds. By default the iteration starts at the root and visits all nodes
    /// beneath it in a depth first manner. The root node is not visited, the first
    /// visited node is a schema node. You can provide a schema name or property path
    /// to select a different starting node. By default this visits the named root
    /// node first then all nodes beneath it in a depth first manner.
    /// <para />
    /// The <c>XMPIterator#next()</c> method delivers the schema URI, path,
    /// and option flags for the node being visited. If the node is simple it also
    /// delivers the value. Qualifiers for this node are visited next. The fields of
    /// a struct or items of an array are visited after the qualifiers of the parent.
    /// <para />
    /// The options to control the iteration are:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>JUST_CHILDREN - Visit just the immediate children of the root. Skip
    /// the root itself and all nodes below the immediate children. This omits the
    /// qualifiers of the immediate children, the qualifier nodes being below what
    /// they qualify, default is to visit the complete subtree.</item>
    /// <item>JUST_LEAFNODES - Visit just the leaf property nodes and their
    /// qualifiers.</item>
    /// <item>JUST_LEAFNAME - Return just the leaf component of the node names.
    /// The default is to return the full xmp path.</item>
    /// <item>OMIT_QUALIFIERS - Do not visit the qualifiers.</item>
    /// <item>INCLUDE_ALIASES - Adds known alias properties to the properties in the iteration.
    /// <em>Note:</em> Not supported in Java or .NET XMPCore!</item>
    /// </list>
    /// <para />
    /// <c>next()</c> returns <c>XMPPropertyInfo</c>-objects and throws
    /// a <c>NoSuchElementException</c> if there are no more properties to
    /// return.
